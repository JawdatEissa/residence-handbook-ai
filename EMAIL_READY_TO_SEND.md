**Subject:** AI-Powered Student Support Tool - Live Demo

---

Hi [Manager Name],

I've developed a prototype that could transform how students access Residence & Housing information. Instead of searching through PDFs or waiting for email responses, students get instant, accurate answers to their questions.

**Try it now:** [YOUR_VERCEL_URL_HERE]

## How It Works

Students ask questions in plain language (e.g., "How do I submit a maintenance request?") and receive immediate answers with:

- ✅ Accurate information from official handbook
- ✅ Page number citations for verification
- ✅ Relevant links (forms, contact info, etc.)
- ✅ Available 24/7

## The Problem It Solves

- Students struggle to find information in 40+ page handbooks
- Support staff answer the same questions repeatedly
- Important resources (maintenance requests, policies) get missed
- After-hours inquiries go unanswered

## Impact & Cost

**Benefits:**

- Instant answers for students (2-second response time)
- Reduced repetitive inquiries to staff
- Better student experience during critical moments (emergencies, move-in, etc.)

**Cost:** ~$50/month for moderate usage (5,000 questions)

## Sample Questions to Try

- "What is the campus emergency number?"
- "Which residences require a meal plan?"
- "How do I report a noise complaint?"
- "What are the guest policies?"

## Next Steps

This is a working prototype ready for testing. I'd love to:

1. Get your feedback on functionality
2. Discuss potential integration with our website
3. Explore adding more resources (forms, FAQs, policies)

The system is built using industry-standard tools (OpenAI, Next.js, Supabase) and includes proper security measures (rate limiting, citations for accuracy, no personal data collection).

**Please try it and let me know your thoughts:** [YOUR_VERCEL_URL_HERE]

Happy to schedule a quick demo call if you'd like to see it in action.

Best,

## Alternative: Even Shorter Email (LinkedIn/Slack Style)

Hi [Name],

Quick question: Would you be interested in an AI chatbot that instantly answers student questions about residence & housing?

I built a working prototype that:

- Answers questions in <2 seconds
- Uses only official handbook content
- Includes citations & links
- Costs ~$50/month

**Live demo:** [YOUR_URL]

Try asking it "How do I submit a maintenance request?" or "What is the emergency number?"

Would love your feedback - takes 2 minutes to test.

## For Internal Slack/Teams Message

Hey team! 👋

I built something that might interest you - an AI assistant for residence & housing questions.

Instead of students digging through PDFs, they can ask questions and get instant answers with page citations.

**Live demo:** [YOUR_URL]

Try it out and let me know what you think! Takes 30 seconds to test.

Sample questions:
• "How do I submit a maintenance request?"
• "What are the guest policies?"
• "Which residences need meal plans?"

All answers come from the official handbook with citations. Built with OpenAI + Next.js.

Thoughts? 💭

## Tips for Your Email

### DO:

✅ Lead with the live demo link  
✅ Use concrete examples ("How do I submit a maintenance request?")  
✅ Mention cost transparency ($50/month)  
✅ Emphasize student benefit, not just tech  
✅ Invite feedback, not approval  
✅ Keep it under 250 words

### DON'T:

❌ Don't overwhelm with technical details  
❌ Don't apologize for it being a "prototype"  
❌ Don't ask for permission - invite testing  
❌ Don't bury the demo link  
❌ Don't oversell - let the demo speak

### Best Opening Lines:

- "I've built something that could help students get answers faster..."
- "What if students could get instant answers to housing questions?"
- "I solved the '40-page PDF problem' - here's a live demo..."

### Best Closing Lines:

- "Try it and let me know what you think - takes 2 minutes."
- "Would love your feedback on this approach."
- "Happy to discuss how this could fit into our student services."

## Follow-Up Email (if no response after 3-5 days)

Hi [Name],

Just following up on the AI residence assistant I shared last week.

In case you missed it: **[YOUR_URL]**

I've had [X people] test it so far with positive feedback. Would still love your thoughts if you get a chance to try it.

No pressure - just wanted to make sure it didn't get lost in your inbox!

Best,  
[Your Name]

## Response to Positive Feedback

---

Thanks [Name]! Glad you found it useful.

Would you be interested in a 15-min call to discuss:

- Adding it to the official housing website
- Expanding to cover more documents/FAQs
- Usage analytics to understand common student questions

I can prepare some mockups showing how it might integrate with current resources.

Let me know if [specific day/time] works!

Best,

## Response to Concerns/Questions

**Concern: "What about accuracy?"**

Great question! The system includes three safety measures:

1. Only uses official handbook content (never makes up info)
2. Shows page citations with every answer
3. Says "I cannot find it" rather than guessing

Happy to show you examples of how it handles edge cases.

---

**Concern: "What about costs?"**

Current estimate is ~$50/month for moderate usage (5,000 questions).

For context, that's about the cost of 2-3 staff hours per month, while the tool could save 10-20+ hours by reducing repetitive inquiries.

I can provide detailed cost breakdowns if helpful.

---

**Concern: "What about maintenance?"**

Minimal ongoing maintenance needed:

- Content updates: Replace PDF + run one command (5 minutes)
- System updates: Automatic via Vercel
- Monitoring: Built-in analytics dashboard

I'm happy to document the process or even maintain it myself initially.
